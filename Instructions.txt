if your blood goes to 0, you die
if your trauma goes to 0, you get knocked out until you go above 10 trauma
attacks deal wounds which will cause you to bleed out.  Wounds slowly heal.   Bandages stop 5 points of bleeding

the less blood or trauma you have left, the more you (or your enemies) will miss.  Trauma loss will cause you to miss 1.5 as much as blood loss.
spears deal almost entirely wound damage, clubs deal almost entirely trauma damage, swords are somewhere in the middle
